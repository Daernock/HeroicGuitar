This repository is for showing some code that I wrote for my project Heroic Guitar.
This project was made using C++. The main game was created in a custom C++ game engine,
the song creator was made using a teacher's 2D game engine (also in C++).

To know a bit more about me, or about this project and the people who helped create this game,
